  '# Air Brake Failures in Big Rigs: Warning Signs Every Driver Should Know

Air brake systems are the most critical safety component on your semi truck. When they fail, the consequences can be catastrophic.

## Understanding Your Air Brake System

### Key Components
- **Air compressor**: Builds and maintains air pressure
- **Air tanks**: Store compressed air for brake operation
- **Brake chambers**: Convert air pressure to mechanical force
- **Brake shoes and drums**: Create friction to stop the vehicle

### Normal Operating Pressure
- **Build-up pressure**: 90-120 PSI
- **Cut-out pressure**: 120-140 PSI
- **Warning buzzer**: Activates below 60 PSI

## Critical Warning Signs

### 1. Pressure Gauge Issues
- **Slow Pressure Build-up**: Should reach 90 PSI within 3 minutes
- **Pressure Drops While Driving**: Warning if drops more than 20 PSI

### 2. Audible Warning Signs
- **Air Leak Sounds**: Hissing sounds indicate air leaks
- **Brake Squealing or Grinding**: Indicates worn brake shoes

### 3. Physical Warning Signs
- **Soft or Spongy Brake Pedal**: Reduced braking effectiveness
- **Brake Pulling to One Side**: Loss of vehicle control

## Emergency Procedures

### If Brakes Fail While Driving
1. **Stay calm** and don''t panic
2. **Downshift** to use engine braking
3. **Use parking brake** gradually
4. **Look for escape routes**
5. **Call emergency services** immediately
